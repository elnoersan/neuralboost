Security Rules Overview

Authentication Required: All read and write operations require user authentication
User Data Protection: Users can only access and modify their own data
Data Validation:

User profiles include validated fields for ID, email, points, ADHD status, and more
Todo items require title, description, target date, and completion status
Questionnaire responses are validated and indexed by user ID
